## Project Overview  
💼 This project presents a comprehensive HR analysis for a company aiming to understand its workforce distribution, salary breakdowns, and departmental trends. The goal was to uncover patterns in employee count 👥, salary allocations 💰, and branch performance 📍—providing actionable insights for workforce planning, budget optimization, and strategic HR decisions.

## Data Sources  
- **HR Dataset**: The main data used is "[original dataset](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20646250/HR.DATA.ANALYTICS.xlsx)"
, which contains detailed information on employee names, departments, salary structures, years of employment, and branch locations.

---

## Tools Used  
- **Microsoft Power BI**: Used exclusively for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data. Power BI’s Power Query and DAX functionalities were essential for transforming the dataset and building dynamic, interactive visuals.

---

## Data Cleaning/Preparation  
All data preparation was done within **Power BI**, using Power Query to:

✅ Remove empty and irrelevant rows.  
✅ Standardize categorical values (e.g., departments, contract types) for consistency.  
✅ Format salary fields to numerical data types for aggregation.  
✅ Ensure no duplicate employee records existed across years.  
✅ Clean up branch names and verify alignment with actual headcount distribution.

Once cleaned, the dataset was modeled in Power BI for easy slicing across multiple filters (year, employee name, department).

## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)  
- What is the total headcount and salary distribution across the company?  
- Which departments have the highest and lowest salary allocations?  
- How are employees distributed across different branches?  
- What are the employment trends over time?  
- Which departments or roles have the most employees?  
- How do different salary types (full-time, contract, hourly) contribute to total salary?

---

## Results/Findings  
📊 **Total Headcount**: 742 employees were analyzed in this dataset.  
💸 **Total Salary**: ₦42,000,000 in total salary allocations.

### Key Insights:

🏢 **Top Department by Salary**: Manufacturing took the lead with ₦8.5M in salary allocation.  

💼 **Departmental Headcount**:  
- Production had the highest number of employees (151), followed by Quality Control and Manufacturing.  
- Several departments (like Research & Dev. and Finance) had significantly lower headcounts (under 10 employees).  

📍 **Branch Distribution**:  
- The workforce was evenly split across three branches: Ikeja, Ilupeju, and Lekki—each hosting 148–149 employees, representing ~20% each.  
- This balance indicates a uniform branch expansion or equal operational demand.

📅 **Yearly Trends**:  
- The highest hiring spikes were recorded in 2006 (96 employees) and 2010 (100 employees).  
- Hiring activity was sparse or nonexistent in some earlier years (1998–2002), with slight growth starting in 2004.

💼 **Salary by Type**:  
- Full-time salaries made up the largest portion at ₦24.2M.  
- Contract, Half-time, and Hourly followed with ₦12.6M, ₦3.2M, and ₦1.5M respectively.

## Recommendations  
📌 **Department-Level Review**:  
- Investigate why Production holds the highest headcount—are roles duplicated, or is this necessary for operations?  
- Consider redistributing roles or automating where possible to optimize salary spend.

📍 **Branch Optimization**:  
- Though branches are balanced, analyze productivity at each branch to ensure staffing aligns with output—not just evenness.

📅 **Strategic Hiring**:  
- Explore what triggered hiring peaks in 2006 and 2010—were these due to expansions, seasonal surges, or restructuring? Use this insight for forecasting.

💼 **Contract Types & Pay Structures**:  
- Full-time roles dominate salary spend; it may be worth exploring hybrid or contractual roles in non-critical areas to manage costs more efficiently.
